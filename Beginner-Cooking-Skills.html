        <p>
          In addition to knife skills, understanding basic cooking techniques is
          crucial for creating a variety of dishes. Whether you’re boiling
          pasta, sautéing vegetables, or roasting meats, knowing the
          fundamentals of each method will allow you to develop your cooking
          skills. Let’s look at some key cooking techniques every beginner
          should know:
        </p>

        <h3>Boiling</h3>
        <p>
          Boiling is one of the most straightforward and commonly used cooking
          techniques. It's ideal for cooking pasta, rice, vegetables, and eggs.
          The key to successful boiling is ensuring that the water is at a
          rolling boil before adding your ingredients. This method helps retain
          nutrients in vegetables and allows grains to cook quickly.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Tip:</strong> Add a pinch of salt to the water when boiling
            pasta or potatoes. It enhances flavor and helps prevent the food
            from becoming too starchy.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sautéing</h3>
        <p>
          Sautéing involves cooking food quickly over high heat in a small
          amount of oil or butter. This technique is perfect for vegetables,
          meats, or seafood and helps preserve their natural flavors while
          adding a crisp texture. It's essential to preheat your pan before
          adding oil to ensure the food sears properly.

          <li>
            <strong>Tip:</strong> Use a pan that can handle high heat, such as
            stainless steel or cast iron, for the best results. Make sure the
            oil is hot before adding your ingredients to avoid steaming the
            food.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Baking</h3>
        <p>

          cakes, and pastries. However, baking is also ideal for roasting meats,
          vegetables, and casseroles. It’s important to understand how to use
          your oven correctly. Preheating your oven ensures that food cooks
          evenly, and monitoring the oven temperature is essential for
          successful baking.

            cooking times precisely for optimal results.

          heat, often on a barbecue. It imparts a smoky flavor, making it ideal
          for grilling meats, fish, and vegetables. Managing grill temperature
          and cooking time is crucial for beginners to avoid overcooking or
          undercooking food.
